Marion G. Müller's major research activities in 2006 centered on further developing her visual archive: Politisch-ikonographisches Archiv der Vision (PIAV) with press-clippings and an image catalogue in both an electronic and in a printed postcard format. The archive is at the center of her current research interest in "Pathosformeln in den Massenmedien". Methodologically she applies the interpretative approach of political iconology in the tradition of the Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg to the social sciences in an effort to make visual material accessible to the problem-oriented scrutiny of mass communication and political science. Her research questions center on the cohesion of democratic societies and the role of visuals in the process of creating and maintaining democratic belief systems. In this context she has devoted attention to the in-depth analysis of the cartoon conflict over Muhammad caricatures published by a Danish newspaper in late 2005 and eliciting violent responses in the Muslim world at the beginning of 2006. A second research focus, connected with the previously mentioned, is the use of images in times of war and terrorism, analyzing terrorist images published in the mass media and providing analyses of the ethical dilemma with which many journalists and editors are confronted in their decisions to publish images produced by terrorists. A third research focus in 2006 has been the scrutiny of perception and reception processes of press photography. The collaborative experimental study with her colleagues Professor Bettina Olk and Professor Arvid Kappas provides for a first and singular methodological combination of eye tracking, visual content analysis (iconology) and psychophysiological measurement of emotional reactions to press photography. The visual stimuli used in the first pilot experiment were violent protests in Nepal in spring 2006. Thus, this collaborative research project is additionally connected with Marion G. Müller's interest in violent reactions to visuals. The theoretical framework for the collaborative study was formulated in an article published (with Arvid Kappas) in the peer-reviewed communication journal \textit{Publizistik} in spring 2006.
