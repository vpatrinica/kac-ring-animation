In recent years Christian Welzel has elaborated a concept of human development which allows analyzing the complex interrelations between the threefold process of economic modernization, cultural change, and democratization on a global scale. A major result of this research is the finding that economic modernization tends to give rise to emancipative cultural orientations, which in turn foster democracy if it already exists or make democracy more likely to emerge if it is not yet in place. 
Seen as a whole, this sequence reflects a broader process of human development in which economic modernization enables, rising emancipative values motivate, and more democracy allows people to pursue self-chosen preferences in their daily activities and lives at large (see Figure \ref{fig:Welzel002}). In the context of this interdisciplinary research, Welzel also helped to gather and to analyze data from the World Values Surveys in an attempt to specify the cultural orientations that are most conducive to honest government and democracy. These orientations have ultimately been identified and characterized as emancipative values (see Figure \ref{fig:Welzel001}).
