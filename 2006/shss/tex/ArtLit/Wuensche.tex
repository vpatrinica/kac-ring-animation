The main focus of Isabel W\"{u}nsche's work in early 2006 was the completion of her study on and the publication of the selected correspondence between Galka E. Scheyer, American representative of the Blue Four, and the Blue Four artists Lyonel Feininger, Alexej von Jawlensky, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee. Published in an English-language as well as a German-language edition by Benteli, Berne, in spring 2006, the extensively annotated correspondence focuses on the transatlantic, artistic dialogue and the introduction of European modernism to the United States. Isabel W\"{u}nsche has continued to cover the following areas: (a) organic abstraction, biocentric modernism, and the influence of the life sciences upon modernist art and design during the period 1890-1960 (various papers, major contribution to an exhibition catalogue, book chapters, preparation of an anthology with University of Pittsburgh Press); (b) ongoing work concerning the Organic School of the Russian avant-garde (various papers, book publication plans with UK publisher); (c) an extended study of the Leningrad Sterligov School that pursued abstraction in the spirit of the avant-garde during the period 1960-1990 (various papers, exhibition project at Rutgers University to be concluded in 2007). A new research project on \textit{European Modernism: Cultural Identities between National Presentation and International Orientation} was initiated with a symposium on the contribution of Russian art to European modernism in August 2006 and is currently being developed into a collaborative research project with an international team of colleagues.
