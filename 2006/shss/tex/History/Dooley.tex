Current research is focused on structures of communication and knowledge transfer from the formation of the first information networks to modern times. A major hypothesis of this research is that technological developments in communication were determined by cultural shifts requiring access to knowledge. In detail, Brendan Dooley is working on the following topics: (a) \textit{Information Networks in the Making}, which is a multiuniversity project to form an international database for the study of information networks in $17^{\rm th}$ century; (b) \textit{The Marble Prince: A Biography of Don Giovanni de' Medici}, a study of war and culture at the end of the Italian Renaissance; (c) \textit{University Teaching and Biological Communication}, a project to show the role of oral culture in the formation of biological knowledge in $18^{\rm th}$ century Europe, focusing on newly discovered manuscripts; (d) \textit{Energy and Culture}, an international transdisciplinary collaboration project, studying the ways in which cultural factors affect public opinion regarding energy issues; and (e) \textit{Art and Value}, an International transdisciplinary collaboration project, studying the ways in which a market value has evolved for some of the most precious cultural values existing in society.
