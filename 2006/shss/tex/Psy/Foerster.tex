Jens F\"{o}rster's research focuses on basic principles of information processing and motivation that underlie diverse social phenomena. In 2006, more than 200 experiments have been conducted with the following results: \textit{Global processing styles} (looking at the forest) enhance abstract thinking, creativity, similarity search, abstraction of meaning, and reduce prejudice, whereas {\itshape local processing styles} (looking at the trees) enhance concrete and analytic thinking, dissimilarity search, and detail perception. Global vs. local processing can be elicited by {\itshape approach/avoidance motivation, regulatory focus, positive/negative mood} and {\itshape right/left hemisphere activation}, and studies show that they have similar effects. To illustrate, a study found that if participants compared their athletic skills to high (Michael Schumacher) or low standards (Helmut Kohl), they assimilate their judgments toward the standard when in a good mood (e.g., think that they are more athletic after comparison with Schumacher and less athletic after comparison with Kohl) - whereas contrast effects occurred when in a bad mood (e.g., think they are less athletic after comparison with high and more athletic after comparison with low standards). Three papers were submitted. Further studies examined the impact of {\itshape novelty} on thinking, showing that framing events as novel leads to activation of broader categories than framing events as familiar. A paper is under revision. A cognitive model on {\itshape love} vs. {\itshape sex} was designed. Studies found that unconscious reminders of love make people more creative, enhance face recognition, lead to global processing and Halos, whereas unconscious priming of sex enhances analytic thinking, recognition of verbal information, local processing and reduces Halos. Three papers have been submitted. Moreover, Jens F\"{o}rster finished reviews on unconscious self regulation (one paper is under revision; three book chapters are in press), and two book chapters on embodiment and approach/avoidance motivation were submitted. He is currently editing a book on Social Cognition and a popular book on prejudice has been accepted by dva/Random House and will appear March 2007.
