Much of Arvid Kappas' current research centers around the role of implicit processing in social context effects of facial behavior. This research uses a variety of paradigms, including inducing affective behavioral responses, assessed using facial electromyography (EMG) as well as Implicit Association Tasks and a modified version of the Affective Simon Task. The goal of these experiments is to understand the processes underlying the behavioral phenomena first demonstrated by Hess, Banse, and Kappas (1995). The experimental work is linked to the PhD thesis of Dennis Küster as well as with the preparation of a DFG grant proposal. Early results have already been presented at international conferences and manuscripts are currently being prepared to be submitted. A transdisciplinary research project (with Olk and Müller, IUB) investigates how different groups of people perceive press photography, how they interpret the visuals and how they react to them. The project is unique as it combines for the first time the methods of eye tracking (perception analysis), iconology (meaning interpretation) and psychophysiological measurement (emotional reaction). Collaborative research is ongoing with Eva Krumhuber and Antony Manstead (Cardiff University, UK) on the perception of facial behavior. In this latter line of research synthetic faces are used to create dynamic stimuli to understand the role of temporal aspects of facial displays in person and expression perception. Further research is ongoing with John Charlton (Bolton University, UK) on anger while driving and computing. Furthermore, Arvid Kappas is in the early stages of collaboration with Thalia Wheatley (Dartmouth College) on the perception of human and artificial movements and Paul Whalen (Dartmouth College) on the role of specific components of smiling behavior.
