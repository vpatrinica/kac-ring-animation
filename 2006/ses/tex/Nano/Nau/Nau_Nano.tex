Supramolecular assemblies are composed of several molecular entities held together by weak intermolecular interactions. By rational selection of the components, nanomolecular materials with functional properties can be designed. For example, large macrocyclic host molecules with concave cavities can accommodate organic molecules as guests. If the selected guest molecule possesses additional receptor sites, e.g., for cations, and if a fluorescent molecule is selected as guest, fluorescent sensors for cations can be constructed. To by-pass the need for organic solvents, and to enable biological or environmental applications, it is generally desirable to select water-soluble host molecules, e.g., cyclodextrins, calixarenes, and cucurbiturils.\\
We are constructing photonic devices based on supramolecular architectures, fluorescent sensor systems for analytes, and metalloenzyme models. These have applications, among others, for fluorescence imaging, dye lasers, information storage, detection of trace elements, and bioassays, for example to detect neurotransmitters.



\paragraph{Highlights}

Macrocyclic host molecules have long been recognized as enzyme models. In 2006, we have communicated a conceptually novel but exceptionally simple supramolecular approach to metalloenzyme models in aqueous solution. It is based on the dynamic self-assembly between macrocyclic hosts with cation receptor properties, organic guests, and metal ions (see publication \cite{Nau9}). In the resulting ternary complex, the guest is held in place by hydrophobic interactions with the host, while the metal ion experiences attractive Coulombic interactions with the negative charges positioned at the portal of the macrocycle. We have examined the resulting ternary complexes both in aqueous solution, where functional aspects are of prime interest, as well as in the solid state, where structural aspects can be studied in detail. Figure \ref{fig:nau_nano} shows the structures of the ternary complexes based on 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene as guest included in the cavity of \textit{p}-sulfonatocalix[4]arene as macrocyclic host and capped by transition metal ions as third component.\\
%
The close investigation of these complexes has allowed us to scrutinize the phenomenon of ``host-assisted metal-ligand bond formation'', because the complex between guest (inside the cavity) and metal ion (the lid on the upper rim, see Figure \ref{fig:nau_nano}) is only formed in the presence of the macrocyclic host. In addition, we observed a fascinating interplay between cooperative and competitive binding, which infers a striking selectivity for the formation of the ternary complexes as a consequence of a triple recognition pattern. Finally, based on the same working principle, we were able to use metal ions as enhancers in fluorescent sensor applications based on host-guest complexes; in this manner, a refined sensor for acetylcholine could be constructed (see publication \cite{Nau9}), which further improved the sensitivity of this supramolecular neurotransmitter sensor just introduced in the same year (see publication \cite{Nau1}).

In addition, we have investigated in 2006 host-assisted $\mbox{p\textit{K}}_{\mbox{{\footnotesize a}}}$ shifts (see publications \cite{Nau3} and \cite{Nau6}), which we plan to elaborate on during the next years. We have also authored a concept article in \textit{Supramolecular Chemistry}, in which we introduce a new assay principle, which we referred to as protolytic displacement assays (see publication \cite{Nau12}); these assays exploit the previously observed $\mbox{p\textit{K}}_{\mbox{{\footnotesize a}}}$ shifts accompanying host-guest complexation for sensing purposes. Finally, we have been able to develop a high efficiency ``green'' dye laser based the use of rhodamine 6G in aqueous solution (see publication \cite{Nau14}). This dye laser by-passes for the first time the use of organic solvents, and instead employs water as environmentally benign and explosion-safe solvent. This application is made possible by the addition of cucurbit[7]uril as a supramolecular stabilizer. The new line of dye laser has the added advantage of an improved photostability and beam shape, which is the result of the advantageous thermo-optical properties of water as laser medium.\\
Additional applications of macrocyclic hosts deal with their effects on enzymatic activity, which will be described separately.\newline \newline Werner Nau is also involved in ``Bioassay Development and Biopolymer Dynamics and Structur''.
