\label{MolLifeSc}

The Molecular Life Scientists at International University Bremen devote their research activities to the understanding of macromolecules and of the biochemical pathways which build up the units of life - our cells. The integration of cellular functions in the broader context of natural biological systems is an important aim of the research groups involved. A strong focus is set out to uncover the molecular mechanisms which maintain vital functions of healthy life. Hence, main expertise and research activities of Molecular Life Scientists are in the field of Molecular Medicine. The aim is to identify targets for drug design for the development of better treatments and therapies of diseases which challenge the modern world.\\

Our motivation is to combine basic sciences, modeling and simulation approaches, biochemical, cell and molecular biological approaches, assays employing organismic model systems as well as analyses of environmental habitats in order to answer key questions concerning the organisms of all divisions of life. \\

Key-questions of the research groups of the Molecular Life Sciences
at IUB comprise the understanding of
\begin{myitemize}
\item   DNA methylation as an important regulator for gene expression in bacteria and mammals,
\item   the concerted rearrangements of gene expression during growth and development,
\item   the significance of protein degradation for proper function of epithelial organs in adult mammalian organisms,
\item   the importance of brain glial cells for development of neurodegenerative diseases,
\item   the molecular mechanisms of the anti-viral immune response,
\item   the importance of virulence factors of plants during their response against  phytopathogens,
\item   molecular interactions of marine bacteria with each other and with phytoplankton cells,
\item   characteristics of diverse microbial habitats in the ocean, and
\item   the interaction of chemicals with marine life for the identification of biomarkers to predict toxic effects.\\
\end{myitemize}


Centrally important are the interactions between the groups that allow us to study molecular mechanisms and to deduce principles which are of significance for the complexity of all biological systems. Underlying principles governing gene expression and hence, proliferation and differentiation of cells are covered to a comparable extent as principles regulating the interaction of microbes, plants, and animals that live in terrestric and marine habitats.\\
