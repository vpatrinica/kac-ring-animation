\subsection{Biophysics}

The Biophysics section at Jacobs University Bremen is a very good example of modeling and experiment joining forces in an attempt to understand the link between structure and function of biomolecules. The objects of interest are membrane proteins involved in antibiotics transport, which place this endeavor well within the target areas of research at Jacobs.\\

Highlights of 2006 in the Biophysics section include a Summer School on biosensing and a deeper understanding of the passage of antibiotics through the membrane channel.\\
