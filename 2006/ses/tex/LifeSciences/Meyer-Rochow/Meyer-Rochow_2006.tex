The research carried out by us fell into three broad categories: (i) work related to comparative aspects of vision and other light-dependent phenomena, (ii) work related to life in the polar regions (i.e., the Antarctic and the Arctic), and (iii) work related to humans. There are, of course, overlaps and our theoretical study on the light-path in the eye of the Antarctic krill could be classified under headings (i) or (ii). Other research, like our electron microscopic work on the retinal fine-structures of beetles and centipedes or our publications on aspects of human health and welfare are more easily assignable to one of the categories. Principles that guide our research are ``comparative aspects'' and the importance of ``linkages'' between phenomena that, on occasion, seem little related to one another, but which, on closer inspection, often reveal numerous and exciting connections.

\paragraph{Highlights}
%
One of the highlights has clearly been the discovery through electrophysiological recordings from the eyes of live house centipedes (\textit{Scutigera coleoptrata}) that this crepuscular species not only has extraordinarily sensitive eyes, but that its spectral sensitivity peak lies in the UV at 350 nm wavelength. Another highlight was our paper on the unusual retinal organization and ultrastructure of a phylogenetically ancient centipede, the Tasmanian \textit{Craterostigmus tasmanianus}. Work in collaboration with scientists from Kalinigrad University (Drs. V. Zhukov, S.L. Borissenko, I.A. Vakoliuk) provided an example of the multipronged approach we are aiming for in all of our investigations of animal visual systems: light- and electron microscopy for structural elucidations, optical measurements and computer-assisted analyses to determine ray paths, and electrophysiological recordings and behavioural tests to investigate function. Two papers on invertebrate eyes that would be of interest to biologists active in applied fields were one that dealt with the juvenile eye structure and putative visual capacity in planktonic larval rock lobsters and a second one that investigated the photoreceptor organization in a species of beetle considered a pest on account of its habit to attack mushrooms.  A theoretical paper that presented a method to calculate the refractive index distribution in the dioptric systems of compound eyes of species that are difficult to obtain and/or impossible to transport alive to a laboratory equipped with an interference microscope, was published in the American ``Journal of Theoretical Biology'' and represented the 'fruit' of an international effort between Dr J. Gal in Hungary, Dr T. Miyazaki in Japan and Dr VB Meyer-Rochow at
IUB.\\
On the ``human health front'' several interesting results with inputs from our group to the Finnish coordinators of the research were published. Perhaps the most important of the findings is that contrary to the world-trend as well as WHO-data on suicides in the elderly (persons older than 65 years of age), in Finland this age-group displayed statistically significant lower incidences of suicides over a 15-year period than the age-group of the 18 - 65 year olds. Participation as an invited speaker at an Ethno-Entomology Symposium organized by Kyoto University is worth mentioning and so is the ongoing collaboration with Professor T. Hariyama and colleagues of Hamamatsu Medical University in Japan on functional aspects of rock lobster vision and extraretinal photoreception in fireflies.\\
Discussions with suicide researchers in Oulu (Finland) continued and saw a project emerge, which is led by Meyer-Rochow (i.e., suicides in visually-impaired people).\\
Another project that was started this year in collaboration with Korean scientists deals with the presence, significance, and origin of UV-patterns on the wings of butterflies and can be seen as an expansion of the current study of sexual eye dimorphism in insects, effects of UV-radiation on insect eyes, and phylogenetic relationships based on retinal ultrastructure. An examination of the eye of the commercially important slipper lobster (in collaboration with Prof. Ehud Spanier of Haifa University) has yielded first results and suggests high overall as well as polarization sensitivity for the eye of this crustacean. Finally, a highlight of a different sort was that even throughout the year 2006 our penguin publication of 2003 (Meyer-Rochow VB \& Gal J: Polar Biol. 27, 56-58) remained the most-viewed article of the ``Springer Verlag'' journal ``\textit{Polar Biology}''.

\paragraph{Organization}
%
For his two months of research at Hamamatsu Medical University Meyer-Rochow received an invitation from the ``Society for the Promotion of Science'' in Japan.  The stays in Taiwan (one month) and South Korea (two months) were prompted by invitations from the Taiwan Academy of Sciences and Chonnam University, respectively.  Meyer-Rochow is one of the organizers of Hampyeong 2008 World Butterfly \& Insect Expo in South Korea.
