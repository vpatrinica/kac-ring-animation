While within the Biophysics section, research attempts to understand the relation between protein structure and function and the Computational Biology studies place structural data into a systemic context, research in the Biotechnology section is about the \textit{design} of function.\\

Here the research activities range from enzyme design and directed protein evolution to large-scale screening for functional properties and molecular modeling as a route towards bioengineering.\\

In this form Biotechnology research at International University Bremen successfully addresses target areas ranging from energy and materials to water and food, as well as health. The wide variety of 2006 highlights demonstrate impressively the impact Biotechnology research at Jacobs already has on these target areas. These highlights include intense and successful joint projects with industry, several patents, substantial progress in carrying gene silencing technology to human cell lines and proofs of principle to several biotechnological and bioengineering concepts.\\
