A multiple approach is used to determine the influence of temperature on virulence and fitness enhancing gene expression in plant associated bacteria, such as Pseudomonas syringae and Erwinia amylovora. These phytopathogens cause devastating diseases on numerous host plants and represent excellent genetic model systems to investigate molecular plant-microbe interactions and pathogenicity. Our efforts focus on six major objectives: 1) the investigation of the regulation of biosynthesis of the phytotoxin coronatine; 2) the molecular analysis of cellular changes occurring at moderate temperature shifts; 3) the identification, analysis and molecular characterization of so far unknown thermo-responsive virulence and fitness determinants or secondary metabolites; 4) investigation of temperature-dependent protein secretion and exopolysaccharide synthesis; 5) molecular analysis of biofilm formation and silver toxicity; and 6) molecular and ecological investigations of multi-drug efflux pumps. Recently, a novel approach was launched to investigate the molecular interaction of marine heterotrophic bacteria with phytoplankton cells involved in carbon dioxide fixation in the ocean.

\paragraph{Highlights}
The year 2006 saw significant progress in a number of our research projects, from which the following three will be highlighted.

After the temperature-sensing mode of CorS, a histidine kinase involved in regulation of synthesis of the phytotoxin coronatine in Pseudomonas syringae, had been uncovered in the previous year, focus was set to generate hybrid kinases. These are composed of the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of CorS variants coming from temperature-dependent and temperature-independent strains of P. syringae. Our results suggested that both the N-terminal part of CorS as well as the presence of the cognate response regulator, CorR, from the temperature-dependent strain are important for full activity of CorS. Moreover, we identified another coronatine-producing strain which shows an opposite temperature behavior. With the help of this strain, we are going to further fine-analyze the temperature sensing mechanism of CorS.

The project on levansucrase, its regulation and secretion was intensified. The role of levan as nutritional storage compound in P. syringae biofilms could be demonstrated (Fig. \ref{fig:profUllrich}).

Levansucrase is an extracellular enzyme which occurs in two allelic
forms in P. syringae. It polymerizes fructosyl residues and thus
forms the exopolymer, levan. Interestingly and despite their close
similarity towards each other, both allelic enzymes occur in
different cellular compartments. Likewise, both genes, lscB and
lscC, are expressed in a clearly temperature-dependent manner. The
two PhD projects focusing on levansucrase have been directed towards
regulation and secretory mechanisms, respectively. The levansucrase
gene could be introduced into the levan-minus bacterium, Pseudomonas
putida, in order to identify regulators and/or the secretory pathway
for its gene product. Expression and secretion of levansucrase in P.
putida did not occur unless a genomic library of P. syringae was
provided. If so, three cosmids renders the P. putida transformants
levan-positive. After demonstrating that the levan formation of
these transformants was due to a simultaneous presence of cosmid and
lscB, the actual genes responsible for this phenotype were cloned
from the respective cosmids. Currently, we have zoomed into an
approximately 12-kb region containing several regulatory genes and
some hypothetical conserved genes. Regulation of levansucrase was
further studied by nested deletion analysis of the promoter region
of lscB. Approximately 440 bps upstream of the translational start
site are necessary to express lscB. Next steps will be to express
genes from the cosmids responsible for levansucrase expression in P.
putida, purify them and undertake DNA-protein interaction studies
with the minimal promoter sequence derived for lscB. Simultaneously,
a random mutagenesis was started to identify the transport system
for levansucrases.

A major highlight of this year's research was our participation at the research cruise ``VISION'' organized by the International Max Planck Research School for Marine Microbiology. Our research aimed at the analysis of interactions between heterotrophic marine bacteria with phytoplankton cells. This interaction is involved in the formation of marine snow which in turn contributes to carbon dioxide fixation in the ocean. This process is extremely relevant for global warming. Taking into account our previous results on plant-microbe interactions, the involvement of biofilm formation and exopolysaccharide synthesis, as well as multidrug efflux systems, our major aim is to identify a genetically feasible model organism which adheres to phytoplankton cells and is involved in aggregate formation. For this a marine transect was carried out obtaining more than 230 culturable bacterial isolates from water samples derived from 66°N,30°W to 30°N,30°W. Currently, the genetic feasibility of the isolates is analyzed. This novel project will allow us to study the interaction of a model strain with phytoplankton cultures and thus apply genetic tools to analyze this interaction at the molecular level.
