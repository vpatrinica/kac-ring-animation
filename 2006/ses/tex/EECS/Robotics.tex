\subsection{Robotics and Embedded Systems} %
Robotics is the driving force behind the increasing omnipresence
of automation, not only in industry but also in many areas of our
daily lives. In addition to their well-established role as
programmable machine-tools, robots are more and more used in
domains where some autonomy and intelligence is necessary, where
the system is not constantly supervised by a human operator and
where it has to be adaptive as the developer of the system can not
fully predict which situations the system will encounter in its
application environment. The related computer hardware and
software are the key ingredients of robots.
