Computer networks such as the Internet continue to change many aspects
of our daily life. The networks and protocols research group carries
out research related to Internet protocols, with strong relationships
to work undertaken by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an
organization responsible for Internet protocol standardization, and
the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), an organization responsible
for longer-term research related to Internet protocols.

\paragraph{Highlights}

The operation of increasingly complex communication networks requires
supporting systems, so called network management systems.  Network
management protocols and associated data definitions have been
developed and standardized over the last decade to support open,
vendor-neutral access to management and control information.  While
some of these technologies are in wide-spread usage, there is little
information how the underlying protocols are utilized and what the
specific characteristics of network management interactions are. As a
consequence, there are no well accepted models which can be used to
analyze the impact of protocol changes.

\end{figure}

A larger empirical study has been started in 2006 where we collect network management
packet traces from operational networks. This study is carried out in collaboration with
international research groups and supporting operators in order to obtain traces from live
networks. Based on an anonymization algorithm developed in 2005 \cite{HS06}, our group has
designed and implemented a tool chain (Fig.~\ref{fig:snmpdump}) for the analysis of
network management traffic traces \cite{PSHSM07}. Further research is ongoing to develop
analysis algorithms able to infer high-level management operations from observed primitive
protocol operations.

\end{figure}

A related activity concerns the security of network management
interactions (Fig.~\ref{fig:sshtls}). We have prototyped and analyzed
a security extension proposed for the SNMP which leverages transport
layer security protocols such as SSH or TLS \cite{MS06}. This work is
related to standardization efforts undertaken by the Integrated
Security Model for SNMP (ISMS) working group of the IETF.

Finally, we have conducted research on the performance of voice stream
transmission over the new Data Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)
being standardized by the IETF \cite{BENB07}. This work was carried out in
close collaboration with NEC C\&C Research in Heidelberg, Germany.
