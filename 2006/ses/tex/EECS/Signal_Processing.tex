\subsection{Digital Signal Processing}


Signal processing is currently strongly linked to machine learning
and communication. Examples for the latter are applications of the
so-called analog codes which have relations to multicarrier
modulation. Moreover, aspects of multicarrier modulation, such as
bit-loading, peak-to-average ratio reduction, and equalization are
studied. Furthermore, algorithms for mobile positioning are
investigated.
