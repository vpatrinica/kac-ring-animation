\subsection{Knowledge and Information Management Systems}


Today's information services are rapidly changing from statically served data to
information that is dynamically tailored to each individual user's current needs. This
information is fetched instantaneously from networked, distributed sources which
themselves change and evolve continually. At the same time, new representation formats
allow to discover and specify the internal and functional structure of information and
drive services that previously required (human) understanding. Technically, we observe the
convergence of databases, Internet, and distributed systems into semantically enriched
knowledge systems which allow the casual as well as the professional user to deal with the
ever-growing amount of information available.  Another issue is the presentation of
information to the user.  Data visualization is concerned with the management of large
data, the filtering and extraction of salient features, and their visual representation in
an expressive, intuitive, and interactive manner.
