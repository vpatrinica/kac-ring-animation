In the Spring semester of 2006 I studied Convex Analysis, preparing for
the publication of
two articles in collaboration with J.~Brinkhuis 
({\sl Convex Analysis. Theory and
Applications} and {\sl Duality and Calculus of convex objects}), and the
theory of
extremal problems, preparing for the publication of another two articles 
({\sl The Lagrange
principle for smooth-convex problems} and {\sl Newton method and applications to
differential equations
and the theory of extremum}).
