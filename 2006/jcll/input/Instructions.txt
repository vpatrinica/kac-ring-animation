- I named the jpgs according to the chapters they belong in and then in the order they appear. Hope that is helpful for you.

- there is an additional chapter (9) included in the report this year, as we have a new professor. Please insert this chapter in the template by Anke Allner.

- Please don't put the red text into the Latech document that applies to the grant sections - this is for your information only. I will send you the missing information regarding grants shortly. 

- The text parts (chap. 6 and 8) in red might also be changed. You can put it in the document already, but I will I will hopefully send you new text for these parts shortly.

- I highlighted the places in the text where it is referred to the figures (whose numbers are not yet completely sure) in yellow. These numbers will have to be inserted in the correct form (in the text as well as in the figure captions) as soon as the introductory part and chapter 4 have been written by Dean Staudinger (with possibly a few figures). I will send you this info around Dec 15.

- please *leave out* chapters 1 AND 4 AND 7 (!) at the moment, as they are still being written / shortened / revised and everything inserted there at the moment will probably still change.

- The faculty picture on the introductory page still needs to be taken - I will send you it around Dec 10. The order of the faculty members in the text therefore probably will change!
