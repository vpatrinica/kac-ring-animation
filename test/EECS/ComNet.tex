\shorttitle{Communication Networks and Systems}
\subsection{Communication Networks and Systems}

The basic desire of modern society to be able to access and
distribute ``any'' information at ``anytime'' and ``anywhere'' is
the driving force for the rapid development of communication
networks and systems. The implications of these goals are manifold
and require truly interdisciplinary research efforts. A typical, but
clearly not complete, list of involved high level research fields
includes

\begin{myitemize}
\item Wireless Network Engineering and System Design
\item Network Interoperability
\item System capacity management and optimization
\item Information transmission
\item Network protocols 
\item Information security.
\end{myitemize}

All these research areas are strongly inter-related and the strength
of a research cluster in ``communication networks and systems''
resides in the close cooperation of the respected research groups
involved. The particular `flat hierarchy' at IUB (no departments and
chairs) fosters such cooperations.
