The general research activity of the Kortz group at
IUB is in the field of synthetic inorganic and organometallic
chemistry. We are particularly interested in the preparation and
structural characterization of large molecular assemblies called
polyoxometalates. Polyoxometalates (or polyoxoanions) are
metal-oxygen clusters with a tremendous structural variety and
interesting properties in different fields including catalysis,
medicine and materials science. The multitude of potential
applications has led to significant interest in polyoxometalates
worldwide. Our research activities are mainly focused on (a)
hybrid organic-inorganic polyoxoanions and (b) transition
metal-substituted polyoxoanions. The former class is of potential
interest in medicine (virus and tumor inhibition, e.g. AIDS) and
the latter in the areas of chemical and electrochemical catalysis
(e.g. oxidation of organic substrates by dioxygen) and materials
science (e.g. sensor technology, single-molecule magnets).
Polyoxoanions are synthesized and structurally characterized at
IUB using a multitude of solution and solid-state analytical
techniques (e.g. NMR, XRD, IR, UV-Vis, AA). Investigation of the
properties of our novel compounds is also accomplished in
collaboration with expert colleagues from around the world (e.g.
Prof. N. Dalal, Florida State University, USA and Prof. L. Nadjo,
Universit\'{e} Paris-Sud, France).

{\sl Supramolecular Chemistry}: Wheel-Shaped Poly\-oxo\-tungstate
\BPChem{[Cu\_{20}Cl(OH)\_{24}(H\_{2}O)\_{12}(P\_{8}W\_{48}O\_{184})]\^{25-}} Macro\-anion
Forms Supramolecular "Blackberry" Structure in Aqueous Solution\\
\\
The hydrophilic polyoxotungstate
\BPChem{[Cu\_{20}Cl(OH)\_{24}(H\_{2}O)\_{12}(P\_{8}W\_{48}O\_{184})]\^{25-}}
$(\mathbf{Cu}_{20}\mathbf{P}_8\mathbf{W}_{48})$ self-assembles into single-layer, hollow,
spherical "blackberry"-type structures in aqueous solutions, as studied by DLS, SLS, zeta
potential analysis and SEM techniques (Fig.~\ref{kortzfig1}). This represents the first
report of blackberry formation for a non-Mo-containing polyoxometalate. The shape and size
of the blackberries do not change during the slow blackberry formation process, neither
with polyanion concentration nor with temperature. Our results suggest that blackberry
formation is most likely a general phenomenon for hydrophilic polyanions with suitable
size and charge in a polar solvent, and not a specific property of polyoxomolybdates and
their derivatives. The $\mathbf{Cu}_{20}\mathbf{P}_8\mathbf{W}_{48}$ polyanions are so far
the smallest type of polyanions (equivalent radius \mbox{$<2\;nm$}) to date showing the
unique self-assembly behavior, helping us to move one step closer towards identifying the
transition point from simple ions (can be described by the Debye-H\"{u}ckel theory) to
polyanions in very dilute solutions.

{\sl Molecular Magnetism}: Observation of a Half Step Magnetization
in the \BPChem{\{Cu\_3\}}-Type Triangular Spin Ring\\
\\
We report pulsed field magnetization and ESR experiments on a \BPChem{\{{Cu\_3}\}}
nanomagnet, where antiferromagnetically coupled \BPChem{Cu\^{2+}} ($S = \frac{1}{2}$) ions
form a slightly distorted triangle. The remarkable feature is the observation of a half
step magnetization, hysteresis loops, and an asymmetric magnetization between a positive
and a negative field in a fast sweeping external field (Fig.~\ref{kortzfig2}). This is
attributed to an adiabatic change of magnetization. The energy levels determined by ESR
unveil that the different mixing nature of a spin chirality of a total $S = \frac{1}{2}$
Kramers doublet by virtue of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is decisive for inducing
half step magnetization.

  magnetization is scaled to $g \mu_BS$. The thin line is the calculated isothermal
  magnetization curve. Arrows denote sweep directions $(A \rightarrow B \rightarrow C
  \rightarrow D)$. The inset shows the pulsed magnetic field versus time.}

{\sl Oxidation Catalysis}: Bio-Inspired Oxidations with
Polyoxometalate Catalysts\\
\\
Transition metal-substituted polyoxometalates (TMSP) provide a redox-active metal center
(e.g. Mn, Fe, Ru) with a totally inorganic ligand system, featuring rigid polydentate
binding sites, high electron-acceptor character, extreme robustness and interesting
structural and coordination properties, in some cases, mimicking the coordination geometry
of natural oxygenase enzymes.  The synthesis and reactivity of TMSPs can be promoted by
microwave (MW) induced dielectric heating. Iron(III)-containing POMs with nuclearities
1-4, namely \BPChem{[$\alpha$-Fe(H\_2O)SiW\_{11}O\_{39}]\^{5-}},
\BPChem{[$\gamma$-Fe\_2(H\_2O)\_2SiW\_{10}O\_{38}]\^{6-}},
\BPChem{[$\alpha$-Fe\_3(H\_2O)\_3SiW\_9 O\_{37}]\^{7-}} and
\BPChem{[$\beta$-Fe\_4(H\_2O)\_{10}(XW\_9O\_{33})\_2]\^{n-}} (\BPChem{X = Se\^{IV},
  Te\^{IV}; As\^{III}, Sb\^{III}}; n $= 4,6$) were found to catalyze the MW assisted
cyclohexane oxygenation with high turnover frequencies. Preliminary results indicate that
the Krebs-type Fe-polyoxotungstates can also promote the oxidative cleavage of
3,5-ditert-butylcatechol with molecular oxygen.\\
\\
{\sl Nanomolecular Science}: STM/STS Observation of Polyoxoanions
on HOPG Surfaces\\
\\
A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy
(STS) techniques have been performed on the wheel-shaped
\BPChem{[Cu\_{20} Cl(OH)\_{24} (H\_2O)\_{12} (P\_8 W\_{48} O\_{184})]\^{25-}} and the
ball-shaped
\BPChem{[\{Sn(CH\_3)\_2 (H\_2O)\}\_{24} \{Sn(CH\_3)\_2\}\_{12}
  ($A$-PW\_9 O\_{34})\_{12}]\^{36-}}
deposited on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces.  Small, regular molecule
clusters as well as separated single molecules were observed. The size of the molecules is
in agreement with the data determined by X-ray crystallography. In STS measurements, we
found a rather large contrast at the expected location of the Cu metal centers in our
molecules, i.e. the location of the individual Cu ions in their organic matrix is directly
addressable by STS.
