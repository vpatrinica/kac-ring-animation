\subsection{Microelectronic Devices and Technologies}

To continue the rate of progress in information and systems and
technologies into the next decade fundamental questions in material
science and manufacturing technology have to be answered to further
reduce the device dimension into the sub 100nm arena and increase
the complexity of integrated circuits. Novel Micro and Nano
Technologies are needed, either to overcome limitations to further
shrinking of devices and/or to implement novel electronic
hardware/services (such as large flexible displays). In parallel to
the development of novel devices, the integration into large volume
manufacturing processes and the specific problems associated to
manufacturing and quality/reliability engineering of these have to
be addressed, according to the principles of concurrent engineering.
