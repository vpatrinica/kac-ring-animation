Model reduction seeks to replace a large-scale system of differential
or difference equations (the outcome of discretizing a PDE, perhaps) by a
system of substantially lower dimension, that ideally, has the same
response characteristics as the original system,
yet requires far less computational resources for realization than the
potentially unmanageable levels that may be required by the larger original
system.

Two main currents can be identified among methodologies for model reduction.
Balanced approximation methods are built upon a family of
ideas with very close connection to the singular value decomposition.
These methods preserve stability and allow for global error bounds but
often do not scale well in terms of
computational efficiency and stability when applied to large scale problems.
Moment matching methods are based principally on Pad\'e-like
approximations and for large-scale problems have lead naturally to the
use of Krylov and rational Krylov subspace methods. These methods generally
enjoy greater efficiency  and numerical stability.
A strong current trend aims at combining these two approaches by deriving
iterative methods which achieve approximate balanced reduction.

Our research activities are concerned with the circle of ideas surrounding
model reduction. It provides efficient
and robust methods for producing reduced order models of
large state space systems.  These activities
have an impact both in system theory of complex systems
as well as in applied mathematics and in particular numerical methods for
large-scale problems.  Once the theory and computational
methods are developed, we expect that high quality software will result and
have applications in many areas of engineering.
This will enable at a later stage,
the design of real time controllers for complex systems.

{\it Broader impact resulting from the proposed activities}.
In today's technological world, physical processes are
described mainly by mathematical models, which are used to
simulate the behavior of the physical processes in question.
Sometimes, they are also used to modify or control their behavior.
In this framework, there is an ever increasing need for
improved accuracy which leads to models of high complexity.

The basic motivation for system approximation is the need in many
instances for a simplified model of a dynamical system, which
however captures the main features of the original complex model.
This need arises from limited computational, accuracy, and storage
capabilities. The simplified model is then used in place of the
original complex model, either for {\it simulation}, or {\it control}.

Important areas of application of model reduction are: VLSI
(Very Large Scale Integration) design, weather prediction,
air quality management, molecular dynamics simulations, simulation and
control of chemical (e.g. CVD - Chemical Vapor Deposition) reactors,
car windscreen quality management, simulation and control of MEMS (Micro
Electro Mechanical Systems) devices, e.g. micromirrors, to name but a few.
Thus the proposed activities have potential benefits for society at large.
