Scientific visualization deals with the visualization of data with spatialinterpretation such as computer-generated data from numerical simulations (physics,chemistry) or measured data using scanning or sensoring techniques (medicine, lifesciences, geosciences).  The group's efforts are to generate visualization methods thatcan handle large data sets efficiently, filter distinct features automatically orinteractively, and display the relevant information in a comprehensive and intuitivefashion.  The research focuses on segmentation and isosurface extraction, hierarchicalmethods, multi-variate data visualization, flow and tensor field visualization, and userinteraction.Information visualization deals with the visualization of abstract data with no spatialinterpretation such as graph- or network-based data (life sciences, social sciences) ormulti-dimensional data (databases, ecomomics).  The group's efforts focus on interactiveexploration and analysis tools for such abstract data.In the areas of computer graphics and geometric modeling the group's interest lies inpoint-based methods, multi-resolution surface representation, and curves on surfaces.\paragraph{Highlights} \ \\{\em Direct Isosurface Extraction from Scattered Volume Data.}Isosurface extraction is a standard visualization method for scalar volume data and hasbeen subject to research for decades.  Nevertheless, no isosurface extraction methodexisted that directly extracts surfaces from scattered volume data without 3D meshgeneration or reconstruction over a structured grid. We have developed a method based onspatial domain partitioning using a $k$d-tree and an indexing scheme for efficientneighbor search. Our approach consists of a geometry extraction and a rendering step. Thegeometry extraction step computes points on the isosurface by linearly interpolatingbetween neighboring pairs of samples. The neighbor information is retrieved bypartitioning the 3D domain into cells using a $k$d-tree. The cells are merely described bytheir index and bitwise index operations allow for a fast determination of potentialneighbors. The final rendering step uses point-based rendering techniques.\begin{figure}[ht]  \begin{center}    \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{Linsen_2006_Fig1.pdf}    \caption{Point-based ray tracing of isosurface directly extracted from a scattered      volume data.

These approaches address some shortcomings of theMC methods including feature-detection within a cell and better triangles. We havedeveloped a simple method based on the MC method and the ray intersection technique tocompute isosurface points in the cell interior. One of the advantages of our method isthat it does not require Hermite data, i.e., the discrete scalar values at verticessuffice. We compute ray intersections to determine isosurface points in the interior ofeach cell, and then performed a complete analysis of all possible configurations togenerate a look-up table for all configurations.  We use a look-up table to optimize theray intersection method to obtain minimum number of points necessarily sufficient fordefining topologically correct isosurfaces in all possible configurations.\noindent{\em Structure-accentuating Dense Flow Visualization.}Vector field visualization approaches can broadly be categorized into approaches thatdirectly visualize local or integrated flow and approaches that analyze the topologicalstructure and visualize extracted features. Our goal was to come up with a method thatfalls into the first category, yet reveals structural information. We have developed adense flow visualization method that shows the overall flow behavior while accentuatingstructural information without performing a topological analysis. A flow integration stepgenerates a density field by tracing particles under the influence of the underlyingvector field. The resulting density is high in attracting regions and low in repellingregions. Density is measured by the number of particles per region accumulated overtime. The density fields for forward and backward propagation are explored usingtexture-based rendering techniques.  We obtained dense flow visualizations that displaythe overall flow behavior, emphasize critical and separating regions, and indicate flowdirection in the neighborhood of these regions.\begin{figure}[ht]  \begin{center}     \includegraphics[width=\hsize]{Linsen_2006_Fig2.pdf}    \caption{Structure-accentuating dense flow visualization applied to 2D simulation of      a swirling jet.}    %\caption{Structure-accentuating dense flow visualization applied to 2D simulation of a swirling jet.}     % \label{fig:profxxx}   \end{center}\end{figure}\noindent{\em Visual Analysis of Gel-free Proteome Data.}We developed a visual exploration system supporting protein analysis when using gel-freedata acquisition methods. The data to be analyzed is obtained by coupling liquidchromatography (LC) with mass spectrometry (MS). LC-MS data has the properties of beingnon-equidistantly distributed in the time dimension (measured by LC) and being scatteredin the mass-to-charge ratio dimension (measured by MS).  A hierarchical datarepresentation and visualization method is used for large LC-MS data. Based on thisvisualization we have developed a tool that supports various data analysis steps likedeisotoping, landmark-based registration, and differential protein expressionanalysis. Our visual tool provides a global understanding of the data, intuitive detectionand classification of experimental errors, and extensions to LC-MS/MS, LC/LC-MS, andLC/LC-MS/MS data analysis.\paragraph{Organization}% list the (research) events you have organized, if any,\begin{enumerate}\item International conference on {\em Visualization in Medicine and Life Sciences (VMLS    06)} held July 19--21, 2006, at Binz, R{\"u}gen, Germany  (http://www.lars-linsen.de/vmls).
