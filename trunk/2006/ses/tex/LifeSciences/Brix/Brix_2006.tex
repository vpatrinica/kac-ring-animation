Our research focus is to understand epithelial organs such as intestine, skin, and thyroid on the cellular and molecular level. As a biomedically-oriented group, our goal is to analyze the functions of these organs and to propose concepts, which might help in the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Our research is focused on proteolytic processes performed by lysosomal cysteine cathepsins. Using a combination of biochemical, cell and molecular biological research approaches, we analyze the spatio-temporal regulation of proteolysis and protease interaction in networks existing in defined biological systems of mammalian organisms. Thus, we get more insight into a general understanding of proteolytic processes in order to interfere with immobility of the gut with its most severe clinical complication of intestinal atony, scar formation as a result of improper wound healing of the skin, and dysfunction of the thyroid resulting in hormone deficits.

The main task of the thyroid gland is the production of thyroid hormones which are essential for brain development, growth, and regulation of metabolism and body temperature. Disorders of the thyroid are frequently observed. Hypothyroidism and goiter may arise as a result of iodine deficiency. In severe cases of low-iodine diets the phenotype of cretinism still occurs. We identified thyroglobulin, the precursor of thyroid hormones, as one of the natural  substrates of lysosomal cysteine peptidases. Through the use of cathepsin-deficient mouse models, we showed that the intra- and extracellular actions of cathepsins B, K, and L maintain thyroid function. Recently, we began to investigate the significance of cysteine cathepsin K for proper brain development in mouse models by combining behavioral studies with biochemical and cell biological approaches in order to explain the observed learning and memory phenotypes on the molecular level.

In cell-based assays, trafficking analyses were performed that comprised expression of GFP-tagged cathepsins with or without active-site-mutations, and cathepsin variants derived from tumor cells, as well as the use of activity-based probes to visualize transport and proteolytic activities of the enzymes in living cells. The results proved that the primary sequence and proper folding of the proteases is sufficient to correctly target cysteine cathepsins into endocytic compartments of normal epithelial cells. However, altered trafficking in carcinoma cells often results in mislocalization of cysteine cathepsins. Hence, cellular transport logistics do not depend on the cargo but rather on the cells themselves. This notion bears important implications for the molecular mechanisms underlying altered transport pathways of cysteine cathepsins in pathological conditions such as cancer.

During regeneration from wounding, secreted cathepsin B mediates keratinocyte migration for rapid wound closure by proteolysis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Specific receptors at the plasma membrane ensure restriction of the proteolytic activity of cathepsin B to the basal pole of the migratory cells. In contrast, trafficking of cathepsins L and V follows different routes in keratinocytes. Cathepsin L remains largely unaffected when human keratinocyte cell lines were wounded. However, a truncated version of cathepsin V is translocated to the nuclei of regenerating cells before keratinocytes start to proliferate. Future experiments aim to verify a causal relation between these two events and shall elucidate the molecular mechanisms that are initiated by the appearance of cathepsin V within the nuclei of keratinocytes.

Recently, we hypothesized that non-regulated release of proteolytic enzymes as a result of tissue damage due to surgical trauma may have dramatic consequences for the affected tissue. Our studies on intestine trauma focus on the possible contribution of cathepsins to the onset of inflammatory responses, ultimately leading to dysfunction of intestinal smooth muscles and post-operative ileus, which is a severe and potentially life-threatening complication common in the clinics. Using standardized models of intestine trauma in mice and rats, we observed a local cathepsin B release concomitant with extracellular matrix damage during initial post-operative phases. Interestingly, cathepsin B-deficient animals showed an increased deposition of extracellular matrix components in the intestine. We concluded that the observed massive degradation of extracellular matrix in traumatized intestine might be a result of direct proteolytic action of released cysteine peptidases such as cathepsin B, or be driven by a more indirect activation of proteolytic cascades. As a possible consequence of the alterations of proteolytic activities due to trauma, impairment of the mucosal barrier function can occur, which will in turn severely affect homeostasis of the intestine. To assess the role of cathepsins during trauma at the molecular level, we established an \textit{in vitro} model that allows to simulate surgical trauma through mechanical compression of cultured intestinal epithelial cells. Finally and most recently, we established a transgenic mouse model with intestine-specific expression of GFP-tagged cathepsin B under the control of the A33-antigen promotor that now allows to directly investigate cysteine peptidase trafficking as well as its release and re-internalization pathways during the acute inflammatory phase and during regeneration from surgical trauma of the intestine.

In conclusion, analysis of trafficking, regulated secretion and non-regulated release of lysosomal cysteine cathepsins in combination with the identification of their natural substrate targets will help to better understand the biology of epithelial cells in physiological and pathological circumstances.
