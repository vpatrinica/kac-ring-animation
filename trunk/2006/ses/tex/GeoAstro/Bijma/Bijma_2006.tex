In the section Marine Biogeosciences at the AWI we work on global change related issues at the level of the organism, the ecosystem or long term biogeochemical cycles. These different scales of time and space are investigated by combining experimental approaches with numerical modelling and field verification. Research topics include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Global biogeochemical cycles and specifically the role of the marine carbon cycle in global change.
\item Paleoclimatology (the glacial to interglacial transition, Holocene variability and the anthropogenic climate disturbance).
\item Stable isotope and trace element geochemistry. We are particularly keen on developing and verifying (paleo)proxies  with the aim of replacing empirical relationships by a process-based ("mechanistic") understanding (proxies are measurable descriptors (i.e. estimators) of desired but unobservable parameters and are used to reconstruct environments or climate in Earth history).
\item Marine calcification: One aspect is to determine the impact of ocean acidification on calcifying organisms, the other is to understand the mechanisms of calcification and proxie incorporation.
\end{itemize}

% 500 words about highlights in 2006

Testing prognostic climate models for future climate change critically depend on our ability to quantitatively reconstruct past climate. This basically translates to using robust proxies for paleo-temperature and -salinity in order to accurately reconstruct the thermohaline circulation (density fields). However, despite more than 50 years of paleoceanographic research, paleosalinity remains the single most important oceanographic parameter which can currently still not be quantified directly from sedimentary records. Therefore, one of the scientific highlights of this year were a couple of successful laboratory experiments towards development of such an independent salinity proxy.

Single celled marine phytoplankton (haptophyte algae, dinoflagellates and several diatom species) were cultured at different temperatures and salinities to investigate the impact of these factors on the hydrogen isotopic composition of specific compounds biosynthesized by these organisms. Two species of haptophyte algae have been analysed so far and it turned out that salinity has a substantial impact on the stable hydrogen isotopic composition of long chain alkenones ($\delta$D) and hence, that $\delta$D has a huge potential as proxy of paleosalinity \cite{Bijma1}!

In cooperation with experimental physicists from the University of M\"unster, we are getting close to determine the boron isotopic composition of single foraminiferal shells. This will allow us to estimate the the pH of deep water on the basis of benthis foraminifera, of which only few specimens are present in the cores retrieved by paleoceanographers \cite{Bijma2}.

Another highlight was the good turn-out of the field-work in Puerto Rico, where R\'{e}gine da Rocha carried out experiments on the incorporation of (trace)elements into planktonic Foraminifera. Our field- and laboratory work has been filmed and will be part of the documentary "Exploring time", produced and broadcasted by "Science Channel".
