Research in the realm of Geosciences and Astrophysics focusses on the
observation and qualitative and quantitative description of
\textit{natural} phenomena on Earth and in the Universe, on the
detailed study and experimental and computational simulation of the
controlling processes, and on the utilization of the information
gleaned from natural systems in high-tech applications, such as
renewable energy, \BPChem{CO\_2} sequestration, and communication
technology. As such, the individual research projects that are all
embedded in a range of natural and international collaborations with
academia and industry, constitute a well-balanced portfolio of basic
and applied research.
