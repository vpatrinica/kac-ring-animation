At the same time, it is increasingly apparent that at theboundaries of different modeling regimes, computations based on thefundamental laws of physics are, more often than not, under-resolvedin the textbook sense of numerical methods.  Because of the vast rangeof scales involved in modeling even seemingly simple systems, thislimitation will not be outgrown by Moore's law within any realistictime frame.  One therefore has to develop numerical methods and/ormodel reductions which capture crucial structures even if the methodis far from ``converging'' in the strong mathematical sense.My own contributions relate to the preservation of Hamiltonianstructure and, consequently, the retention of relevant conservationlaws under model reduction or numerical discretization.  In fluidflow, energy cascades to small scales, so that the Hamiltonian picturemust be supplemented by a parametrization of subscale energydissipation.  I am working on development and study of rationalsubscale closures.\paragraph{Highlights}In joint work with Oliver B\"uhler (Courant Institute) I have studiedthe closure problem of fluid dynamics in terms of dispersive waves inFourier space.  We have demonstrated that this point of view isfruitful in an idealized model setting: passive advection with smoothvelocity fields.  The closure conditions can then be formulated interms of \emph{transparent boundary conditions for lattice waves}.  Adetailed study in the context of simple shear flows has been completed\cite{OliverBuehler}.  Figure~\ref{fig:OliverBuehler} compares a naiveGalerkin closure, which is conservative and, consequently, containsartifacts due to ``reflections'' at the truncation boundary in Fourierspace, with the new nonreflecting closure at the same resolution whichapproximates the correct behavior very well.  Of course, the Galerkinclosure represents in some sense a worst-case behavior---the point isthat its deficiencies can be understood and eliminated in a rationaland systematic way.  Generalizations of these results to morerealistic modeling scenarios are currently under way.\begin{figure}[ht]  \begin{center}    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Oliver/Oliver-Figure1.pdf}} \hfill    \fbox{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{Oliver/Oliver-Figure2.pdf}}     \caption{Evolution of a tracer field in a shear flow.

This is advantageous in situations where the preservationof the invariants matters more than strong trajectory accuracy of thesolution.  The approximate preservation of invariants can beunderstood in terms of a \emph{backward error analysis} using resultsfrom Hamiltonian normal form theory.  In the context of ordinarydifferential equations, this has been known for about 15 years.  Buteven for simple partial differential equations, the semilinear waveequation being a simple relevant model problem in this context, theseclassical proofs appear to break down.  In recent work with ClaudiaWulff (Surrey), we have shown that, under somewhat strong assumptionson the smoothness of the solutions to the semilinear wave equation,the main features of the finite dimensional theory survive\cite{OliverWulff}.  We believe that these smoothness assumptions canstill be relaxed by using Lagrangian normal form transformations as wehave successfully applied to model reduction for geophysical fluid flowin earlier work \cite{Oliver}.  This is current work in progress.\emph{Particle methods for fluid flow} are a different kind ofstructure preserving discretization.  They are especially successfulwhen flows have huge variations in density, free boundaries, andchanges in domain topology.  There is renewed interest in particlemethods in the context of geophysical fluid flow, primarily because ofthe ease with which advected tracer concentrations andparametrizations of essentially Lagrangian subscale physics can bebuilt into the model.  While conservation of the various masses istrivially satisfied, conservation of energy and angular momentum isnot automatic.  In joint work with Onno Bokhove (Twente) we have shownhow rather general fluid models can be reduced to a ``parcelHamiltonian formulation'' which provides a reduced Hamilton structurethat, while still in the continuum, survives under a naturalrestriction to a finite number of parcels\cite{BokhoveOliver,BokhoveOliver2}.  My PhD student VladimirMolchanov is working on a particular particle method, the HamiltonianParticle-Mesh Method of Frank, Gottwald, and Reich.  He has recentlyproved that this method converges.  Current work relates to thequestion whether his result is sharp, and whether modifications of themethod can yield a better rate of convergence.\paragraph{Collaborations}\begin{enumerate}\item {\sl Twente University, The Netherlands} \\Dr.\ O.
