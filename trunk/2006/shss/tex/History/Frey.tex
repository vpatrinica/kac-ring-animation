Marc Frey's research activities have broadly centered on North-South relations in the $19^{\rm th}$ and $20^{\rm th}$ centuries and on aspects of international and transnational history of Southeast Asia in the $20^{\rm th}$ century. In the area of North-South relations, research has been focusing on four projects: (a) \textit{Colonial Law, Colonial Injustice}, which analyses forms of plural legalism in European and Japanese colonies in Africa and Asia in light of its implications for the development of international law and traces the connections between state law, public law and criminal law on the one hand and the changing character of international law in the period from c. 1870 to the onset of decolonization; (b) two projects are related to nation building, economic development and social change in the era of decolonization and early independence, one traces the role of elites in the decolonization process from a transdisciplinary perspective, the other analyzes development policies of Asian countries in the period 1945-1975; (c) \textit{Development Policies in Global Perspective}, is intended as a textbook, to be published with Beck Publishers Munich, on the history of development policies in contemporary history and traces the origins of development doctrines, theories and regimes, evaluates the results and shortcomings of development policies, and draws conclusions from past experiences with development policies for our time; (d) finally, together with two IUB colleagues, the project \textit{Asianisms in the $20^{th}$ Century} looks at processes of integration and differentiation, of condensation and demarcation within Asia from a cultural, societal, economic, and political perspective.
