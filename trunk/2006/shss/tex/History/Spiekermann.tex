Uwe Spiekermann's major research focus in 2006 was the history of 20th century German nutrition. He continued his work on his habilitation project \textit{K\"{u}nstliche Kost. Die Durchsetzung der Wissensgesellschaft und die Erfindung der modernen Ern\"{a}hrung in Deutschland 1880-2000}, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft: Since the late 19th century science, market and society were established and differentiated as specific systems, characterized by their own rationality and heterogeneous types of efficiency. This was a typical element of "modern" knowledge societies: Growing opportunities and wealth were accompanied by structural uncertainty, growing risks and hazards. Practical and objective knowledge were more and more diverged, frictions and tensions among everyday experience and systemic logics became typical. The project will analyze emergence, development and consequences of a knowledge society by analyzing nutrition and eating in Germany as an example. The implementation of a new scientific understanding of food and nutrition, based on nutrients and physiology, altered the traditional relationship of nature and culture fundamentally. This invention of a "new" nutrition led to new and more efficient ways of supply, production and distribution, which are analyzed in detail. On the other side nutrition and eating became an oscillating field of public and individual fears and hopes, which stress structural problems of knowledge societies in the age of affluence.
