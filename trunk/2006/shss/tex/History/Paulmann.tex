The Helmut Schmidt Chair of International History was established during 2003 with funds from the ZEIT-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd Bucerius. The chair holder Johannes Paulmann's research and teaching covers the historical development of today's connected world from the $18^{\rm th}$ century to 1990/91 based on a broad conception of International History. While also covering the classical field of international politics the emphasis is on topics of transnational relations between societies and cultures. Cross-border processes and structures are studied analysing historical precursors of the contemporary global entanglements. The scholarly aim is innovative in the context of recent scholarship and, on account of its topicality, attracts interest from a wider public.
