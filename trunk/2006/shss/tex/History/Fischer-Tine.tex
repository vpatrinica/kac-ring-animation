Apart from producing various articles for the Global History Network on "World Orders", the research activities of Harald Fischer-Tin\'{e} were mainly focused on the completion of his post-doctoral project \textit{"Low and Licentious Europeans": White Subalterns in Colonial India (1784-1914)}. The work for this project (which comprised 11 months of archival research in Britain and South Asia) was started in 2000. The manuscript has been completed in October 2006 and submitted as \textit{Habilitationsschrift} to the Faculty of Philosophy, Universit\"{a}t Heidelberg in that same month. A slightly altered version is currently under consideration by two international publishers (Ashgate, Alderhot and Orient Longman, Hyderabad) for publication.
