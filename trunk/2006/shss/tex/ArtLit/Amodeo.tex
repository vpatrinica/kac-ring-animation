Immacolata Amodeo has continued and diversified her research activities in the field of migrant literatures: (a) she worked on gender-related questions and literary texts written by migrant women writers of Italian origin in Germany; (b)  she studied the works of migrant writers with Spanish as first language (in the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR); (c) she has further developed the comparative study of migrant literatures; d) she has analyzed linguistic aspects of migrant literatures. The analysis of linguistic aspects of migrant literatures led to the organization and establishment of an international and interdisciplinary research group (scholars from Germany, Italy, France and several African countries are involved) under her direction and a joint grant application with a research proposal on multilingualism and migrant literatures in Germany, Italy, and Canada from a comparative perspective (VolkswagenStiftung, program \textit{Studiengruppen zu Migration und Integration}, decision pending). Furthermore, she has started translating (from German into Italian) a collection of short-stories by the author of Italian origin Franco Biondi living in Germany and writing in German which she is committed to editing for publication in Italy in 2007. Immacolata Amodeo has also refined her analysis of political and cultural mappings of criminality and nationality in traditional and new media. This research (in collaboration with Eva Erdman, Universität Erfurt) lead to the idea of an online atlas of crime fiction and to data collection on the basis of contemporary crime novels.
