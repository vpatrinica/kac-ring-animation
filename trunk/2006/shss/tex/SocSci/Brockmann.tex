Hilke Brockmann's research in 2006 focused on three research questions: (a) Does population aging increase the demand for health care? (b) How much does a growing older population change the modern state? (c) And how much do policy changes feed back on social inequality? In order to answer the first question Hilke Brockmann conducted a study with colleagues from Universität Bremen analyzing health insurance data in order to investigate how health care reforms and health behaviour interact. Two papers have come out of this project so far, one in a peer-reviewed journal. Research concerning the second question is still at an early stage. Hilke Brockmann is currently writing a paper on "Governing generations" in which she compares family, migration and old-age policies in Germany and the US. She also started a small project on the "Demography of Political representatives" and prepared a grant application. Hilke Brockmann is about to finalize two papers one titled "Reforms that go under your skin. Health care and pension policy reform in Germany and the US" the other "Who care when singles die? Families and care at the end of life". Furthermore, a grant application on Health and Families is in preparation.
