In 2006 Peter Ludes engaged (a) in the transdisciplinary study of media key visuals: The "flows of messages and images", which Manuel Castells saw as the "basic thread of our social structure", implying that "image-making is power-making", are seldom focused upon. Castells' theory of the "network society" therefore requires visual networks as illustrated by TV annual reviews of 2003-05;\\
