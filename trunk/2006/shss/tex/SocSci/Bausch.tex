Prof. Bausch's major research focus has been on evidence-based best practices in strategic management and is anchored in the Center for Management Studies (CMS) at IUB. With the explosion of information from empirical research over the past decades, evidence-based strategic management strives to synthesize and interpret the research findings available in the field. Meta-analysis is to date widely used almost exclusively in medicine and psychology, having set a benchmark there. In the CMS meta-analysis is used to generate theory, to identify emerging issues in the field, to examine controversial or complicated topics, and to explicate "how to" strategies for practitioners. So far, internationalization, innovation, diversification, alliance activities, and mergers and acquisitions have been found to have a significant impact on firm performance.

After the success of the first two "Value Creator" studies (published in 2002 and 2004), a third study has been initiated together with Accenture. This study investigates the critical success factors of energy suppliers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In addition to accounting data from 1999 to 2005, this follow-up study will also be based on a management survey distributed to executives of utility companies. Together with The Advisory House AG a joint research funded by RWE AG analyzing demographic change in Europe and its impact on the labor market has been set-up. The overall aim of the study is not only to forecast the labor market in 2020 but also to develop comprehensive scenarios and to derive scenario specific recommendations for multinational corporations. Additionally, Prof. Andreas Bausch has submitted a research grant proposal on the antecedents and outcomes of radical vs. incremental innovation to the VolkswagenStiftung together with Profs. Michael Frese (Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen), James L. Farr (Penn State University), Shaker Zahra (University of Minnesota). The research team is planning to conduct a cross-cultural study on the influences of institutional, organizational, and psychological factors influencing radical and incremental innovation activity of firms in Germany and the US.
