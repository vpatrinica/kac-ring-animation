Petra Lietz's main research activity in 2006 was the conduct of the second qualitative phase and the third quantitative phase of my research project entitled "Values and learning approaches of IUB's class of 2007". This project is aimed at: (a) examining the way in which different factors operate to influence the achievement of sojourner students, (b) verifying and expanding the understanding of three types of learning approaches, namely achieving, deep and surface learning, and (c) measuring changes in values and learning approaches over time. Analyses of a first path model suggest that personal values can be meaningfully linked to learning approaches and that differences in terms of values exist across genders and across the natural and social sciences. Petra Lietz was also involved in the preparation of two research proposals to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, one within the framework of the Forschergruppe "\textit{Priorisierung in der Medizin}", coordinated by Professor Adele Diederich (see Chapter 7 of this report), the other with Professor Klaus Boehnke and Dr. Nongkran Wongsri from Saint Louis College in Bangkok on learning styles of native and sojourner students in a German-Thai comparison.
