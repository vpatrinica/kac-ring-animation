As in prior years, research of Klaus Boehnke focused primarily on processes of political socialization among youth and young adults, often employing a cross-cultural perspective. Two major research projects have been conducted. The first project studied effects of the EU Eastern enlargement on the mobilization of right-wing extremism in Germany and bordering regions in Poland and the Czech Republic, with funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. This study encompassed representative samples of the border regions of the three countries and is a longitudinal continuation of a study previously funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Science (BMBF). The second project was a long-term panel study of young peace-movement sympathizers from the mid 1980s who have been studied every 3 ½ years since 1985. In 2006 the seven panel wave was conducted. That study focuses on the impact of societal context on individual psychosocial well-being and political activism. In the report phase, work has also continued on two other research projects, one on value transmission in families, another one on problems of social exclusion as a consequence of high achievement in schools ("Streber" study). In addition Klaus Boehnke has prepared two research proposals, one to the BMBF together with Professor Ariel Knafo from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem on identity development and value transmission among migrant youth, and the other to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft together with Professor Petra Lietz and Dr. Nongkran Wongsri from Saint Louis College in Thailand on learning styles of native and sojourner students in Germany and Thailand. He also prepared a proposal to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft together with Professor Ulrich Kühnen to obtain funding for the 19$^{\textrm{th}}$ International Congress of Cross-Cultural Psychology, which he hosts together with Ulrich Kühnen at IUB in 2008.
