Following an interdisciplinary view on human performance that comprises motor, neurophysiological and psychological expertise and methods, our second area of research deals with the role of cardiovascular fitness and motor coordination training on cognitive performance and psychological well-being in older adults. More and more animal and human studies stress the importance of a physically active lifestyle for successful aging (i.e. retarded cognitive decline, improved physiological and psychological health etc.). However, the underlying mechanisms, the dose-response-relationship and also the effects of different types of exercise on cognitive performance are still not well understood.

\textbf{Research Highlights 2006}

 Currently we are performing a one-year longitudinal study to investigate the effect of different types of physical activity on cognitive performance and well-being in older adults. 
\newpage 
This study started in October 2006 and results of baseline measurement are just under investigation. In preliminary studies we developed and evaluated training programs and test batteries for practicing and assessing gross and fine motor coordination in older adults. We also performed a pilot cross sectional study on the effects of different types of physical exercise (endurance training, strength training, mixed training) on cognition and well-being.
