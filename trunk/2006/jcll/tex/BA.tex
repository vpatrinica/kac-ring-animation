\section{A Perspective from Business Administration on the Aging Workforce} \shorttitle{Business Administration and the Aging Workforce}

\textit{``Where is the Wisdom that is lost in Knowledge, Where is the Knowledge lost in Information?''} \\- T.S. Elliot
 
 For demographic fitness, organizations, and in particular companies, need to deal first with an aging workforce and second with achieving global competitiveness through outsourcing, currently focusing on Asia as region with the largest economic growth. 

 For WISE Organizations four key levers can be identified: 

\begin{center} \textbf{Wisdom   Innovation   Strategy   Energy} \end{center}

 Therefore, the JCLL Business Administration area named WISE research group focuses on these four levers with WISE in general as well as WISE Aging and WISE Asia (see Figure \ref{fig1:profSvenVoelpel}).

 Valuable solutions for managing lifelong learning and institutional development need to combine both profound research on and investigation into key levers that determine organizational success.
