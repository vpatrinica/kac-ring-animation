 Competency models are widely used by Human Resource (HR) practitioners in the selection, placement and development of employees. However, only little competency modeling research has been conducted, and the issue of age-related competency changes has hardly ever been addressed. In collaboration with Bosch Rexroth AG, we are developing a competency model that incorporates employees' age-related changes in ability and motivation factors. The model is intended to help identify HR development requirements in the mid-term (5 years).

 Using a goodness-of-fit framework, we will match supervisors' ratings of their employees on competencies described in existing company-specific competency models against employees' ratings of their KSAOs and their perception of how these will change over the next five years. Fit indices will be computed for ability and non-ability-related dimensions to identify mismatches as a starting point for HR development measures.
