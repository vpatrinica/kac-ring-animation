 The Feldpost-Archiv is an archive for the war time generation's personal knowledge. Media are used to communicate experience, opinions, and knowledge. E-mails, letters, and the telephone are examples of individual media. The problem of investigating their content and usage is that they are usually not stored, but forgotten, deleted or thrown away - with one unique exception: Feldpost letters. With the Feldpost Collection, Feldpost letters will be catalogued and coded for scientific use. The data will be accessible over the Internet. The goal is to build a representative, web-based collection of war letters.

 Personal memories, experiences and written statements of the war generation are a valuable subject for research on memory and media, as well as for political psychology. Based on such collections, for instance, background questions about the age-graded effects of propaganda can be asked and hopefully answered in the near future.

\textbf{Research Highlights 2006}

 This year our work concentrated on a survey of so called ``gray literature''. These are publications and editions of war letters and memoirs by war participants or their relatives. Usually these are not critical editions and lack information on provenance. But nevertheless they are important for war letter research and provide a useful source of information if handled with care.
